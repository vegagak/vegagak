- 👋 Hi, I’m @vegagak
- 👀 I’m interested in everything Sinclair ZX81. I bought mine in 1982 from Sinclair of New York and soldered it up on the kitchen counter. This machine was also sold later by Timex as the Timex/Sinclair 1000

- ⚡ Fun fact: I wrote my first program for the ZX81 in 1982. It was a programmer's utility, a full-screen machine language monitor: <a href='https://github.com/vegagak/ZXMon'>ZXMON</a>
